## Eco tech

This is an informational, one page, CSS only, basic interactive website. It focuses primarily on possible solutions to clean up trash within the oceans.

## Demo

There are 6 sections to this website:

1. The navigation bar

<img src="/images/presentation/navbar.png" width="55%"></img>

2. The hero image, the first thing that the users' eyes will land on

<img src="/images/presentation/hero.png" width="55%"></img>

3. The three cards with three diffrent solutions to the problem at hand with links to the website of the solutions

<img src="/images/presentation/cards.png" width="55%"></img>

4. The 'About' section that gives a bit more context as to what is going on in the oceans at the moment

<img src="/images/presentation/about.png" width="55%"></img>

5. A section with a natural solution that is already in the works

<img src="/images/presentation/video.png" width="55%"></img>

6. A contact form

<img src="/images/presentation/contact.png" width="55%"></img>

By clicking on the diffrent elements on the navigation bar, it will send the user directly to that section in the website.

## Graphic design elements

By using Painter Essentials 7, I was able to create some of my own pictures and logo.

The logo seen on the navigation bar was entirely my design.

<img src="/images/logo.jpg" width="55%"></img>

As for the Hero and the photo in the background of the about section, I used the convert to paintings software available on Painter Essentials 7, and then further painted over them to get the to the look that I wanted.

<img src="/images/FEW-hero-image.jpg" width="55%"></img>

<img src="/images/open-ocean-hero.jpg" width="55%"></img>

## Running the code

To run this on your local machine, you must simply type `flask run` in your terminal. 

## Code structure

- Painter Essentials 7 was used for graphic design
- All the images are in an images file
- All the code is commented to explain what it should do
